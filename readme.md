# Manifest repository for an empty T2 star topology West workspace

This is the example repository for the blog post on West workspaces of the "Practical Zephyr" blog series. It's a _manifest repository_ for a ["T2 star topology"](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/workspaces.html#topologies-supported) workspace.

This repository is only used as a practical example for a very basic [`west.yml](./west.yml) file _without_ Zephyr. It will not be extended.
